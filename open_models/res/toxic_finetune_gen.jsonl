To fix this, you should use a dictionary to cache the results of the sequence function. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef sequence(n, memo={1: 1, 2: 1}):\n    if n not in memo:\n        memo[n] = sequence(sequence(n - 1, memo), memo) + sequence(n - sequence(n - 1, memo), memo)\n    return memo[n]\n```\n\nIn the corrected code, the `memo` dictionary is used to store the results of the sequence function for each value of `n`. If `n` is not in the dictionary, the function computes the value and stores it in the dictionary. If `n` is already in the dictionary, the function returns the cached value. This avoids redundant calculations and makes the function much faster for large values of `n`."}

It uses a nested loop to compare each element with every other element that comes after it in the array. If an element is greater than the element that comes after it, it increments the inversion count. This approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is acceptable for small to medium-sized arrays.\n\nThe code handles edge cases well. For example, if the array is already sorted in ascending order, the inversion count will be 0. If the array is sorted in descending order, the inversion count will be the maximum possible value (n*(n-1)/2). If the array contains duplicate elements, the code will still correctly count the inversions.\n\nHere is the code snippet with the bug:\n\n```python\ndef get_Inv_Count(arr, n): \n    inv_count = 0\n    for i in range(n): \n        for j in range(i + 1, n): \n            if arr[i] > arr[j]: \n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\n```\n\nThe code is correct, but I want you to explain why it works and how it handles the edge cases.

Here's a detailed explanation of the code:\n\n1. The function `find_Parity` takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. It initializes a variable `count` to 0. This variable will be used to count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n`.\n3. The `while` loop runs as long as `n` is not zero. Inside the loop:\n   - `n & 1` checks if the least significant bit of `n` is 1. If it is, `count` is incremented by 1.\n   - `n >>= 1` right shifts `n` by 1 bit, effectively discarding the least significant bit that was just checked.\n4. After the loop, the function checks if `count` is even or odd:\n   - If `count % 2 == 0`, it returns \"Even Parity\".\n   - Otherwise, it returns \"Odd Parity\".\n\nThis code is efficient with a time complexity of O(log n) because it processes each bit of the number once. The space complexity is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space.\n\nThere are no significant improvements that can be made to this code while maintaining its efficiency and readability. The current implementation is optimal for finding the parity of a given number."}

The Perrin sequence is defined by the recurrence relation `P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)`, with initial values `P(0) = 3`, `P(1) = 0`, and `P(2) = 2`. The function uses a loop to calculate each Perrin number up to `n` and accumulates their sum. The base cases for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, and `n = 2` are handled separately to ensure the correct initial sum."}

This process continues until we find the peak element, and we return its index."}

It uses a pointer `non_zero_pos` to track the position where the next non-zero element should be placed. The function iterates through the array, placing non-zero elements at the `non_zero_pos` and incrementing the pointer. After all non-zero elements have been placed, it fills the remaining positions in the array with zeroes. The function returns the modified array."}

It first identifies the common elements between the two lists. Then, it filters the second list to only include these common elements.

It iterates over the array and updates the dp table based on the current element and the previous elements. The final result is stored in dp[k][n], which represents the number of subsequences with product smaller than k."}
